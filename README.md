# Refactoring
This repo is for my presentation at Capvision's R&D Team.

To run the code seamlessly, please install `bun.sh` as JS/TS runtime and test runner.
```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

The original code is from the book Refactoring. To make it friendly for IDE, I changed the code from JS to TS.
